    "insertionSort":"Insertion Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting each new element into its correct position within the already sorted portion. It shifts larger elements to the right to make space for the current key.<br><br><b>Time Complexity:</b> Best: O(n), Average: O(n<sup>2</sup>), Worst: O(n<sup>2</sup>)<br><b>Space Complexity:</b> O(1) &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Stable:</b> Yes &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>In-Place:</b> Yes",
    "selectionSort": "Selection Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that divides the input list into a sorted and an unsorted region. It repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion and swaps it with the first unsorted element, growing the sorted portion one element at a time.<br><br><b>Time Complexity:</b> Best: O(n<sup>2</sup>), Average: O(n<sup>2</sup>), Worst: O(n<sup>2</sup>)<br><b>Space Complexity:</b> O(1) &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Stable:</b> No &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>In-Place:</b> Yes",
